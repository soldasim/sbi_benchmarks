- Basically, mostly just check "src/main.jl". Almost all setup should be there.
    - model, acquisition, iters
    - `posterior_estimate`
- Additional settings can include:
    - likelihood stuff in problem definition
    - custom model in "src/main.jl"

### Run Scripts
- All setup of the script should be in "cluster_scripts/queue_jobs.jl".
    - run name
