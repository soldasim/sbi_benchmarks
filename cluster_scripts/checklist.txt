### Experiment Setup
- Basically, mostly just check "src/main_scripts/main_{...}.jl". Almost all setup should be there.
    - model, acquisition, iters
    - `posterior_estimate`
- On cluster additionally check "cluster_scripts/queue_jobs.jl":
    - `run_name` !!!
    - Maybe change `cpulong` to `cpuextralong` for some experiments
