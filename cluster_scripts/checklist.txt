### Experiment Setup
- Basically, mostly just check "src/main.jl". Almost all setup should be there.
    - model, acquisition, iters
    - `posterior_estimate`
- Additional settings can include:
    - likelihood stuff in problem definition
    - custom model in "src/main.jl"
- On cluster additionally check "cluster_scripts/queue_jobs.jl":
    - `run_name` !!!
    - Maybe change `cpulong` to `cpuextralong` for some experiments

### Run Scripts
- All setup of the script should be in "cluster_scripts/queue_jobs.jl".
    - run name
